# ActiveRecord Associations

To get a sense of how ActiveRecord associations work, we'll again refer to the Chinook database we used for the SQL lecture. We'll also be creating our own database later on, but I want to use this database as an example so you can get a sense of how the association macros work with an existing database structure. This is a great opportunity to get a sense of what the `has_many` and `belongs_to` methods actually do with an established database structure. Before we start writing some code, Here's our file structure.

We'll be using `require_all` today to load all files we add in the `lib/activerecord_associations` directory. So, we're free to create multiple files here and trust that they will be accessible to us when we run `rake console`

Also, here's the `Rakefile` to show how we set up the console:

```rb
# Rakefile
require "rspec/core/rake_task"
require "pry"
require "sinatra/activerecord/rake"
require_relative "./lib/activerecord_associations"

desc "starts a console"
task :console do 
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    adapter: 'sqlite3',
    database: 'db/development.sqlite'
  )
  Pry.start
end

desc "chinook console" 
task :chinook do 
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    adapter: 'sqlite3',
    database: 'db/ar_chinook.sqlite'
  )
  Pry.start
end

RSpec::Core::RakeTask.new(:spec)

task :default => :spec

```

Notice we have two separate console tasks defined here. One of them sets up a connection with a development database, another with the Chinook database. We're doing this so we have the ability to create ActiveRecord models that work with the Chinook database as well as a different one if we so choose. This is somewhat similar to having a test database and development database. It allows us to have a separate playground for certain classes. But, we're actually loading all of our classes every time, so we'll need to be aware of which console is running (and therefore which database we're connected to) as this will inform which classes actually have database backing and which ones don't.

Before we run the `chinook` task to start playing around with the Chinook database using ActiveRecord, let's take a look at the `lib/activrecord_associations.rb` file:

```rb
# lib/activerecord_associations.rb
require "require_all"
require "sinatra/activerecord"
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
require_all "./lib/activerecord_associations"

module ActiverecordAssociations
  class Error < StandardError; end
  # Your code goes here...
end
```
Currently, this file is serving as our environment file. It's doing the following:
- loading necessary dependencies 
- configuring the logger for `ActiveRecord::Base` to put out SQL interactions to the `STDOUT`. (So we see the SQL generated by our calls to ActiveRecord methods in the console).
- loads all of the files inside of `./lib/activerecord_associations`. If we add files there, this file will load them. So, if we want to add new files for classes that we add, that will work just fine without adding additional `require` statements.

Because this file is required from the `Rakefile` we should have access to the code in all files within `lib/activerecord_associations`  within our `rake chinook` console.

To start, we have a directory called `chinook` inside of `lib/activerecord_associations` that contains a single file for a model corresponding to one of Chinook's database tables. 

So, right away, we should be able to boot up a console and interact with these classes and call ActiveRecord query methods on them.

Okay, now let's boot up the console by running:
```bash
rake chinook
```

Now, let's try to fetch all of the artists:

```rb
Artist.all
D, [2021-07-06T19:14:03.894004 #92451] DEBUG -- :   Artist Load (2.0ms)  SELECT "artists".* FROM "artists"
=> [#<Artist:0x00007fde5597a780 id: 1, name: "AC/DC">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde559788e0 id: 2, name: "Accept">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde559787a0 id: 3, name: "Aerosmith">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde55978660 id: 4, name: "Alanis Morissette">,

 #<Artist:0x00007fde559783e0 id: 6, name: "Antônio Carlos Jobim">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde559782a0 id: 7, name: "Apocalyptica">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde55978160 id: 8, name: "Audioslave">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde55978020 id: 9, name: "BackBeat">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde543abe90 id: 10, name: "Billy Cobham">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde543abd50 id: 11, name: "Black Label Society">,
 #<Artist:0x00007fde543abc10 id: 12, name: "Black Sabbath">,
```

We can try to find Led Zeppelin too:

```rb
Artist.find_by(name: "Led Zeppelin")
D, [2021-07-06T19:16:14.315974 #92451] DEBUG -- :   Artist Load (4.0ms)  SELECT  "artists".* FROM "artists" WHERE "artists"."name" = ? LIMIT ?  [["name", "Led Zeppelin"], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Artist:0x00007fde50ba48f8 id: 22, name: "Led Zeppelin">
```

We can also access the database table's structure by invoking `column_names` on the class.

```rb
Artist.column_names
=> ["id", "name"]
```

Now, let's give the `Album` class a shot.

```rb
Album.all
D, [2021-07-06T19:19:36.201331 #92451] DEBUG -- :   Album Load (3.1ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums"
=> [#<Album:0x00007fde50bd50c0 id: 1, title: "For Those About To Rock We Salute You", artist_id: 1>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4f58 id: 2, title: "Balls to the Wall", artist_id: 2>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4e18 id: 3, title: "Restless and Wild", artist_id: 2>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4c38 id: 4, title: "Let There Be Rock", artist_id: 1>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4af8 id: 5, title: "Big Ones", artist_id: 3>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd49b8 id: 6, title: "Jagged Little Pill", artist_id: 4>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4878 id: 7, title: "Facelift", artist_id: 5>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4738 id: 8, title: "Warner 25 Anos", artist_id: 6>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd45f8 id: 9, title: "Plays Metallica By Four Cellos", artist_id: 7>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd44b8 id: 10, title: "Audioslave", artist_id: 8>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4378 id: 11, title: "Out Of Exile", artist_id: 8>,
 #<Album:0x00007fde50bd4238 id: 12, title: "BackBeat Soundtrack", artist_id: 9>,
```

And, to check how many there are, we can run a count:

```rb
Album.count
D, [2021-07-06T19:20:19.038096 #92451] DEBUG -- :    (1.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "albums"
=> 347
```

OK, so what if we want only the albums by AC/DC? First, we'll want to find the AC/DC artist:

```rb
artist = Artist.find_by(name: "AC/DC")
D, [2021-07-06T19:21:15.372210 #92451] DEBUG -- :   Artist Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "artists".* FROM "artists" WHERE "artists"."name" = ? LIMIT ?  [["name", "AC/DC"], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Artist:0x00007fde551ec888 id: 1, name: "AC/DC">
```

Then we can use this artist's id and match it up with the foreign key on the `albums` table by doing a where query.

```rb
albums = Album.where(artist_id: 1)
D, [2021-07-06T19:22:09.523018 #92451] DEBUG -- :   Album Load (5.3ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE "albums"."artist_id" = ?  [["artist_id", 1]]
=> [#<Album:0x00007fde5521ca10 id: 1, title: "For Those About To Rock We Salute You", artist_id: 1>, #<Album:0x00007fde5521c8d0 id: 4, title: "Let There Be Rock", artist_id: 1>]
```

#### Alert

While it seems like we're looking at an array here, it's actually not an array of Album instances:

```rb
albums.class
=> Album::ActiveRecord_Relation
```

This will be important later on because it means we still have a connection to the Album class and ActiveRecord methods that we can use to make additional queries if we so choose.
## One-to-Many relationships

As you can imagine, managing object relationships is one of the main repetitive tasks that ActiveRecord could provide support for. And, AR does not disappoint! It just so happens that this artist and this album are related in a one-to-many way.

- an album `belongs_to` the artist. 
- an artist `has_many` albums. 

Modeling relationships in ActiveRecord is as simple as describing the relationship! The code reads much like you would say it:

```rb
class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :albums
end
```

Let's try this out. First, exit out of the console, start a new one and try to `Artist.first.albums`:

```rb
albums = Artist.first.albums
D, [2021-07-06T19:28:25.798385 #95393] DEBUG -- :   Artist Load (0.2ms)  SELECT  "artists".* FROM "artists" ORDER BY "artists"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
D, [2021-07-06T19:28:25.804233 #95393] DEBUG -- :   Album Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE "albums"."artist_id" = ?  [["artist_id", 1]]
=> [#<Album:0x00007ff6bea8fc70 id: 1, title: "For Those About To Rock We Salute You", artist_id: 1>, #<Album:0x00007ff6bea8fb08 id: 4, title: "Let There Be Rock", artist_id: 1>]
```


Awesome! This looks like the same collection we had previously. Let's take a close look at the SQL query generated here and compare it to the previous one.

```rb
# this one
Album Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE "albums"."artist_id" = ?  [["artist_id", 1]]
# previous one
Album Load (5.3ms)  SELECT "albums".* FROM "albums" WHERE "albums"."artist_id" = ?  [["artist_id", 1]]
```

Same query! Is the return value different?

```rb
albums.class
=> Album::ActiveRecord_Associations_CollectionProxy
```

A couple of quick links here:
- [API documentation for ActiveRecord::Relation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/files/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation_rb.html)
- [API documentation for ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/CollectionProxy.html)

For right now, all that's important is that you remember that the association methods return something different from the `ActiveRecord::Relation` we get back from `.all` or `.where`. The main reason we would care is that the type of object we're dealing with tells us what methods we can call on it. If you check the docs linked above, you can see that the `ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy` actually inherits from `Relation`. So, it will have all the same methods that we could call on `Album.all` including additional methods designed to take advantage of the fact that we're dealing with albums that belong to the `AC/DC` artist. You'll be revisiting this topic in greater depth in phase 4.

## Learning how the Magic Works

Just like all the rest of our learnings in ruby so far, we can break everything down to objects, methods, arguments and return values (or side effects). Let's do that here.

```rb
class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :albums
end
```

| Object | Method | Argument | Return Value/side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Artist` | `has_many` | `:albums` | defines methods in the Artist class that help access associated albums. Return value not important, methods main purpose is the side effects (the defined methods) | 

Okay, so if we're looking for documentation, we need to know where this `has_many` method comes from. So, let's think a bit:

- has_many is invoked within the `Artist` class (without an object up front)
- the implicit receive of any method call is what?
- so what object is receiving the call to `has_many`?

**Insert Dramatic Pause Here**

Once we get an answer, let's hop down into console and try to find the `has_many` method.

```rb
Artist.methods.select{|m| m.to_s.match("has_many")}
=> [:has_many]
```

Okay, so this must have come from somewhere because we didn't define it ourselves. The only thing we have in our Artist class is the `has_many` method call, no definition, so it must be coming from our inheritance relationship with `ActiveRecord::Base`. To check that, we can go looking for it there.

```rb
ActiveRecord::Base.methods.select{|m| m.to_s.match("has_many")}
=> [:has_many]
```

Okay, so we've confirmed that this method is coming from `ActiveRecord::Base`, now let's go look at the docs for [ActiveRecord::Base](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html){:target="_blank"}. At the bottom of this page, there's a list of links to included modules. Including a module within a class adds all of its methods. About 2/3 the way down in the list, you'll see [ActiveRecord::Associations](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations.html){:target="_blank"}. There, you'll see a module and a namespace linked at the bottom. Both are relevant when thinking about and working with ActiveRecord association methods:

- [MODULE ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html){:target="_blank"}
- [CLASS ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/CollectionProxy.html){:target="_blank"}

To dig into the `has_many` macro itself, we'll want to check out the top link to the `ClassMethods` module. At the top of this doc, this is how the module is described:

>Associations are a set of macro-like class methods for tying objects together through foreign keys. They express relationships like “Project has one Project Manager” or “Project belongs to a Portfolio”. Each macro adds a number of methods to the class which are specialized according to the collection or association symbol and the options hash. It works much the same way as Ruby's own attr* methods.

The key takeaway for right now is that these methods (`has_many` and `belongs_to`) are macro-like methods. So, much like `attr_accessor` the purpose of `has_many` and `belongs_to` is to add methods to the class. In this case, we use the macros to create association methods. I'd strongly recommend bookmarking this web page and revisiting it often over the next few weeks & months. It contains more information and examples than you'll need at first, but over time, you'll get more out of this doc as you revisit and re-read it. The top part of the documentation gives a bunch of examples and different scenarios, while the bottom of the docs describe the association macros, the options you can pass and the affect that they have on the generated methods. This is the part we'll focus on now. Here are links to the docs for the 2 association macros that we'll be using:

- [belongs_to](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-belongs_to){:target="_blank"}
- [has_many](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.6/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_many){:target="_blank"}

>When we use the `has_many` macro in a class, `ActiveRecord` assumes that the class on the other end of that relationship has an all lower case, snake case foreign key matching the name of the calling class followed by `_id`.

So, when `ActiveRecord` sees 

```rb
class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :albums 
end
```

It makes a few assumptions:

* You have a class defined somewhere called `Album` (uppercase singular of symbol passed to `has_many`)
* The table associated with the `Album` class has a foreign key of `artist_id` (lower case, snake case name of calling class followed by `_id`)
* You want to use the primary key on the `Artist` class's associated table to match with the foreign key on the `Album` class's associated table.

As you may have guessed, you can override these assumptions if you need to! In this case, we can actually see that the primary key is working properly because it's being included in the query:

```sql
SELECT "Album".* FROM "Album" WHERE "Album"."artist_id" = ?  [["artist_id", 1]]
```
What we need is to adjust the name of the foreign key to match what it's actually called within our Chinook database. In order to allow us to override the defaults, both the `has_many` and `belongs_to` macros allow us to pass a second argument (after the name of the association) which is a hash of options. One of these is fittingly called `foreign_key`. 

```rb
class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "Artist"
  has_many :albums, foreign_key: "ArtistId"
end
```

Test this out by restarting `rake chinook` and then running `Artist.first.albums` again. 

```rb
[1] pry(main)> Artist.first.albums
D, [2021-06-14T17:20:20.997680 #70659] DEBUG -- :   Artist Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "Artist".* FROM "Artist" ORDER BY "Artist"."ArtistId" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
D, [2021-06-14T17:20:21.049157 #70659] DEBUG -- :   Album Load (1.0ms)  SELECT "Album".* FROM "Album" WHERE "Album"."ArtistId" = ?  [["ArtistId", 1]]
=> [#<Album:0x00007fac0e99f630 AlbumId: 1, Title: "For Those About To Rock We Salute You", ArtistId: 1>,
 #<Album:0x00007fac0e99efc8 AlbumId: 4, Title: "Let There Be Rock", ArtistId: 1>]
```

This time you're actually getting Albums back!

## One-to-One relationships

Okay, so we've handled the `has_many` side of the relationship, now we need to attend to the `belongs_to` side. Again, the syntax for this reads much like how you would say it:

```rb
class Album < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "Album"
  belongs_to :artist
end
```

Now, let's restart `rake chinook` and try `Album.first.artist`

```rb
[1] pry(main)> Album.first.artist
D, [2021-06-14T17:23:03.445490 #71205] DEBUG -- :   Album Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "Album".* FROM "Album" ORDER BY "Album"."AlbumId" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> nil
```

Hmm, not so much. This SQL statement is a little less helpful as an indicator of what went wrong here. It's only selecting from `"Album"` and not from `Artist` which seems wrong. Given what we know about `ActiveRecord` and the convention over configuration mindset, however, let's assume that we need to tell ActiveRecord to use `ArtistId` as the foreign key. 

```rb
[1] pry(main)> Album.first.artist
D, [2021-06-14T17:26:30.526486 #72010] DEBUG -- :   Album Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  "Album".* FROM "Album" ORDER BY "Album"."AlbumId" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
D, [2021-06-14T17:26:30.549382 #72010] DEBUG -- :   Artist Load (0.5ms)  SELECT  "Artist".* FROM "Artist" WHERE "Artist"."ArtistId" = ? LIMIT ?  [["ArtistId", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Artist:0x00007fa0ff064eb8 ArtistId: 1, Name: "AC/DC">
```

Now we've got two SQL queries. One loading the Album, triggered by `Album.first` and the next loading the associated `Artist` generated when we chain on `.artist`. Belongs to assumes that the foreign key to support the relationship is on the associated table and that it is named `other_model_id`. Because the foreign key in Chinook is actually `ArtistId` we had to specify that by adding the `foreign_key` option when invoking the `belongs_to` macro.

## Many to Many relationships

Using ActiveRecord, many to many relationships are modeled by using a combination of `has_many` and `belongs_to` macros. As before in our `User`, `Tweet`, `Like` example, there will be 6 methods that support many to many. This time however, we'll use macros to define them rather than creating them from scratch. We'll go through it step by step, but before that we'll take a moment to look at an overview.

```rb
class ModelOne < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :join_models
  has_many :model_twos, through: :join_models
end
class JoinModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :model_one
  belongs_to :model_two
end
class ModelTwo < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :join_models
  has_many :model_ones, through: :join_models
end
```

Many to Many will always involve 6 macros: 2 `belongs_to`, 2 `has_many` and 2 `has_many, through`. The join model will have both of the `belongs_to` relationships. Each of the other models will have many of the join and also many of the other through the join. We've already talked about the assumptions `ActiveRecord` is making with respect to `has_many` and `belongs_to`, so let's take a moment here to focus on `has_many, through` and how it's different.

So, with `has_many, through`, `ActiveRecord` is looking to see that the association you're going through exists in the model. For example, this won't work:

```rb
class ModelOne < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :model_twos, through: :join_models
  has_many :join_models
end
```
Because the `has_many :join_models` association has to exist before you can use it to define `has_many, through`. 

Next, the association you're creating through the other association must exist in some form on the through model. The association can be `has_many` or `belongs_to`, singular or plural, but it must exist on the through (join) model.

```rb
ModelOne.has_many :model_twos, through: :join_models
# only works because
JoinModel.belongs_to :model_two
```

If you need to change the name of the association to something that doesn't match an association that exists on the join model, then you need to specify the `source` option.

An example of this would be our `User` - `Like` - `Tweet` example because there are 2 types of relationship between `User` and `Tweet`. One that's one-to-many ther other that's many-to-many. We'd do this in ActiveRecord like so:

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :tweets  
  has_many :likes
  has_many :liked_tweets, through: :likes, source: :tweet
  # because the liked_tweet association doesn't exist within the `Like` class, we need to specify `:tweet` as the source of this association so ActiveRecord knows to go through likes and give us tweets back when we call `liked_tweets`.
end
class Like < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :tweet
end
class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base 
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :likes
  has_many :likers, through: :likes, source: :user
  # because the likers association doesn't exist within the `Like` class, we need to specify `:user` as the source of this association so ActiveRecord knows to go through likes and give us users back when we call `likers`.
end
```

Within Chinook, we can add a many to many relationship between `Playlist` and `Track` through `PlaylistTrack`

```rb
class Playlist < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "Playlist"
  has_many :playlist_tracks, foreign_key: "PlaylistId"
  has_many :tracks, through: :playlist_tracks
end

class PlaylistTrack < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "PlaylistTrack"
  belongs_to :playlist, foreign_key: "PlaylistId"
  belongs_to :track, foreign_key: "TrackId"
end

class Track < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "Track"
  has_many :playlist_tracks, foreign_key: "TrackId"
  has_many :playlists, through: :playlist_tracks
end
```

And now you're able to access the playlists associated with a track:

```rb
[8] pry(main)> Playlist.last.tracks

```


## What is a Macro?

>Simply put, a macro is a method that defines other methods. We use a macro to dynamically add functionality to a class in Ruby.

The first macros that you learned about were `attr_reader`, `attr_writer` & `attr_accessor`. Each of these is responsible for adding a method(s) to the class they are invoked within. Those macros are built into the `Class` class, so we can invoke them on any object we wish. 

```rb
[7] pry(main)> [:attr_reader, :attr_writer, :attr_accessor].all?{|m| Class.methods.include?(m) }
=> true
```

This is a bit weird, but bear with me because I want to make a point about ruby syntax that can make things feel more magical than they are:

```rb
[1] pry(main)> String.attr_accessor :secret
=> nil
[2] pry(main)> h = "hello"
=> "hello"
[3] pry(main)> h.secret = "world"
=> "world"
[4] pry(main)> h.secret
=> "world"
[5] pry(main)> h
=> "hello"
```

This is an example of *monkey patching* (the act of extending one of Ruby's built in classes by directly adding a method to it). These syntaxes are functionally identical:

```rb
String.attr_accessor :secret
```
and
```rb
class String
  attr_accessor :secret
end
```
and 
```rb
class String 
  self.attr_accessor :secret
end
```

To illustrate what this is doing, we can store the array of methods in the string class before invoking attr_accessor and then subtract those from the methods on the String class after we invoke it. For this, open up a new console (using `rake console` or `rake chinook` will both work for this but I'm going to do `rake chinook`)

```rb
string_methods = "hello".methods.sort
String.attr_accessor :secret
new_string_methods = "hello".methods.sort
difference = new_string_methods - string_methods

```
And you'll see this as the value for `difference`:
```rb
=> [:secret, :secret=]
```

ActiveRecord's approach is to add functionalty via inheritance. So if we want to see what we get from `ActiveRecord::Base`, we can use a similar approach.

```rb
class Test 
end
class AR < ActiveRecord::Base
end
ar_class_methods = AR.methods.sort - Test.methods.sort
# you will see a seemingly unending list of methods here. 
# In fact there are 448 of them.
ar_class_methods.length
=> 448
```

The association macros are among these:

```rb
[15] pry(main)> ar_class_methods.include?(:has_many)
=> true
[16] pry(main)> ar_class_methods.include?(:belongs_to)
=> true
```

Again, following this same approach, we can take a look at the methods added by has_many by:
- taking one class that invokes `has_many`
- taking another empty class that doesn't invoke `has_many` (we'll make a new one for this)
- creating an instance of each class and storing them in variables called `with_has_many` and `without_has_many`, respectively.
- subtracting the methods `without_has_many` responds to from the methods that `with_has_many` does.

```rb
class ArtistWithoutHasMany < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "Artist"
end
[2] pry(main)> with_has_many = Artist.new
=> #<Artist:0x00007fddf45ffc60 ArtistId: nil, Name: nil>
[3] pry(main)> without_has_many = ArtistWithoutHasMany.new
=> #<ArtistWithoutHasMany:0x00007fddf8116240 ArtistId: nil, Name: nil>
[4] pry(main)> has_many_methods = (with_has_many.methods - without_has_many.methods).sort
=> [:after_add_for_albums,
 :after_add_for_albums=,
 :after_add_for_albums?,
 :after_remove_for_albums,
 :after_remove_for_albums=,
 :after_remove_for_albums?,
 :album_ids,
 :album_ids=,
 :albums,
 :albums=,
 :autosave_associated_records_for_albums,
 :before_add_for_albums,
 :before_add_for_albums=,
 :before_add_for_albums?,
 :before_remove_for_albums,
 :before_remove_for_albums=,
 :before_remove_for_albums?,
 :validate_associated_records_for_albums]
```

Of these, the one we will interact with most frequently *by far* is `:albums`. There are use cases where the `:album_ids` and `:album_ids=` methods are useful as well. Specifically, those can help out with checkbox inputs that are sometimes used with many to many relationships like the one between a `Post` and a `Tag`. If you want to learn more about [the methods added by `has_many`, APIdock](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods/has_many) is where I'd recommend referring for documentation.

One thing in particular that's special here is that when you call `albums` on an `artist` instance, you actually get an [`ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy`](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/CollectionProxy.html) for the `Album` class. This allows us to invoke methods from ActiveRecord on the collection of `albums` as if it were the `Album` class itself, though we're only concerned with `albums` that belong to the `artist` on which `albums` was invoked. 

We could do the same thing to see what methods `belongs_to` adds to a model.

```rb
class AlbumWithoutBelongsTo < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "Album"
end
[2] pry(main)> with_belongs_to = Album.new
=> #<Album:0x00007ff0ff473220 AlbumId: nil, Title: nil, ArtistId: nil>
[3] pry(main)> without_belongs_to = AlbumWithoutBelongsTo.new
=> #<AlbumWithoutBelongsTo:0x00007ff1029fc590 AlbumId: nil, Title: nil, ArtistId: nil>
[4] pry(main)> belongs_to_methods = (with_belongs_to.methods - without_belongs_to.methods).sort
=> [:artist,
 :artist=,
 :autosave_associated_records_for_artist,
 :belongs_to_counter_cache_after_update,
 :build_artist,
 :create_artist,
 :create_artist!,
 :reload_artist]
```

Of these, the first, `:artist` will be used most frequently, though there are cases where you'll want `artist=` as well. Sometimes `build_artist` will be useful, though this is less likely if you're using react as a frontend.

## Exercise

For the exercise, there are 3 migrations written. 2 Are complete, the 3rd you'll need to fill in before running. (The schema version matches the prior migration, so as long as you wait to run `rake db:migrate` until you've completed the migration, it should work fine). If you run rspec, you should see 12 examples, 7 failures.

After completing the migration and running it, running `rspec` should result in 6 passing specs and 6 failing ones. The final 6 tests are for the association macros you'll need to set up. Open up the file `lib/activerecord_associations/many_to_many.rb` and add the associations to the 3 classes defined there. Once you've finished, all tests should pass.

At this point, you can play around with your 3 classes in the console by running `rake console` Try:
- Creating a couple of new tags
- Creating a new Post
- Adding the new tags to an existing post using `post.tags <<` (watch the SQL that gets generated as you do this.)
- Explore other has_many methods as referenced on [APIDock](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods/has_many)
